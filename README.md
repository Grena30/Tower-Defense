## What is tower defense?
Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy games where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack. This typically means building a variety of different structures that serve to automatically block, impede, attack or destroy enemies. Tower defense is seen as a subgenre of real-time strategy video games, due to its real-time origins, even though many modern tower defense games include aspects of turn-based strategy. Strategic choice and positioning of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre.


## Gameplay

**Basic gameplay elements:**
-   territories, possessions, (collectively, the "base") that must be defended by the player or players
-   waves of multiple incoming "enemies" that must be defended against
-   placement of "tower" elements, such as towers, or obstructions along the path of attacking enemies

What distinguishes tower defense base defending games from other base defending games  is the player's ability to strategically place, construct or summon obstructive constructions and constructive obstructions in the path of attacking enemies.

In a tower defense, the player's main character is often invincible, as their primary objective is the survival of the base rather than the player.
